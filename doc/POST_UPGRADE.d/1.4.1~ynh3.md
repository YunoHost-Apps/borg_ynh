## Borg commands simplified!

Prior to this version, you had to copy the repository hostname or path, specify the borg ssh key, and other boring stuffs just for running the borg command.

You are now able to follow these two simple steps to, say just list your archives:

1. As root, open a shell session logged in as borg (or adjust to `borg__2`, `borg__3` depending on your app id):
```bash
yunohost app shell borg
```

2. Then run the borg command you would like, you don't need to specify the repository anymore:
```bash
# To list the archives
borg list
# Or let's say you want to export an archive
borg export-tar '::MY_ARCHIVE' /tmp/MY_ARCHIVE.tar
```

## Specify the path of borg on your remote server

A new (optional) configuration setting is available, in case setting borg's "remote-path" option (`BORG_REMOTE_PATH`) is needed on the remote Borg server.
