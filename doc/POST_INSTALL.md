You defined the backup target: `__REPOSITORY__`.

You should check out the admin documentation of this app at the bottom of the config panel!

If you selected a remote borg server as backup target (*starting with `ssh://`*), you'll be interested by some additional suggestions (you should now probably install the "Borg Server" Yunohost app on that remote server, or configure SSH access to the remote account using the SSH public key that was just generated during install).
