This app has gone through a major revamp!

The upgrade should be mainly transparent to you. However, if you have multiple instances of this app, one upgrade will break other instances and you'll need to upgrade every instance of borg installed on your server.

Also, developer aren't flawless and we might have missed something during our tests.

We **highly** recommend to check that your backups are still being created after the upgrade.

You can manually trigger borg backups from command line with:

```bash
systemctl start borg
```

Or, for a single app, for example Nextcloud:

```bash
sudo yunohost backup create --apps nextcloud --methods borg_app
```

If you find *any* issue or have a doubt, feel free to contact the YunoHost team on Github or Matrix.

Backups are important. In any case, check your backups regularly.
